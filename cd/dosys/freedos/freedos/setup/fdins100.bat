REM This is the file FDINS section you would modify what list of packages
REM are installed based on the users selections.

REM For best compatibility and ease of implementing future versions of this
REM installer, I recommend that customizations to the list be preformed

REM If you wanted to always include non-standard packages, you could do
REM something like the following in the additional FDINS batch file.
REM
REM copy %FINSP%\FDPLFULL.LST %TEMP%\MYPACKS.LST
REM type %FINSP%\MYLIST.LST (into) %TEMP%\MYPACKS.LST
REM set FKPGS=%TEMP%\MYPACKS.LST

if not exist %TEMP%\FDIMPLES.LST goto NotCustom
set FPKGS=%TEMP%\FDIMPLES.LST
goto Done
